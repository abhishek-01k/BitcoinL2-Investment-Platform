## What is Alvara Protocol ?

The Alvara Protocol is a transformative platform in the DeFi space designed to democratize the world of asset management. Built on the newly developed ERC-7621 token standard, Alvara provides an innovative tokenized basket factory that paves the way for anyone to become a basket manager. This unique ecosystem maintains complete transparency, allowing other investors to confidently contribute to the basket. Alvara adds a whole new subsector to decentralized finance by revolutionizing how we perceive and engage with basket management as both managers and investors.

## What is a BitcoinL2 token & how can I mint one?

The ERC-7621 or "Basket Token Standard" (BitcoinL2), is a new revolutionary token standard developed by Alvara. A BitcoinL2 token encapsulates a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 tokens), offering unique rebalancing capabilities and the issuance of unique LP tokens to contributors.

To mint a BitcoinL2, you must first make a minimum contribution of 1 ETH. With your contribution ready, you can select your preferred tokens with liquidity to form a part of your BitcoinL2. These selected tokens will be bought, split according to your desired weighting, wrapped, and then the BitcoinL2 will be minted - all within a single transaction, to optimize network transaction fees.

Minting a BitcoinL2 token allows you to become a basket manager and control your crypto basket within the Alvara protocol. It's an empowering step towards managing your very own portfolio in the decentralized finance ecosystem.
